# The stdio bridge: Claude Desktop without Node

Metocast's MCP server speaks HTTP. A client that can do that (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, any MCP
SDK) needs nothing else. Claude Desktop's JSON config and some other clients can only **start a
program and talk to it over stdin and stdout**. For those, the Mac app carries the program:

```
metocast-server mcp-stdio
```

It is the same `metocast-server` helper the app already runs as its core, started with a different
first argument. Nothing else is installed: no Python, Node, Docker or developer tools.

```
AI app (Claude Desktop)      metocast-server mcp-stdio                     Metocast
   stdin  ──JSON line──▶     POST /mcp  (token, Mcp-Session-Id)    ──▶     server/mcp.rs
   stdout ◀──JSON line──     200 JSON  |  202  |  text/event-stream  ◀──
                             GET /mcp (event stream)               ──▶     notifications
```

## Connect Claude Desktop

Open **Connectors → AI Agents (MCP)** in the Mac app and turn **Enabled** on first. Then either:

- **Install in Claude Desktop.** Opens the extension that ships inside the app. Claude asks for the
  access token: choose **Copy Access Token** in Metocast and paste it. Leave the address as it is
  when Metocast runs on this Mac.
- **Copy Config for Claude Desktop.** One paste into Claude Desktop's configuration (Settings,
  Developer, Edit Config). The copied config names the bridge and carries the token in `env`.

Either way, **Test Connection** in the same screen runs the check below and shows the result.

Metocast has to have been opened once on the Mac: every time the app starts it points
`~/Library/Application Support/Metocast/mcp/metocast-mcp` at its own helper, and both routes use that
path, so they keep working when the app moves or updates.

Metocast is not notarized yet, so macOS asks you to approve it the first time it opens (System
Settings, Privacy & Security, **Open Anyway**). Do that for Metocast itself; Claude then starts the
helper from inside an app you have already approved.

## How it behaves

- **A dumb pipe.** Each line on stdin is one JSON-RPC message. A request is sent with `POST /mcp` and
  its reply is written as one line; a notification gets `202` and writes nothing. The bridge does
  not look at tool calls.
- **Session.** It keeps the `Mcp-Session-Id` from `initialize` and sends it, with
  `MCP-Protocol-Version`, on every later request. When Metocast has forgotten the session (the app
  restarted, or fifteen idle minutes passed) the server answers `404`; the bridge repeats the
  client's own `initialize`, then `notifications/initialized`, and sends the failed request again.
  The AI app is not told.
- **Notifications from Metocast.** After `initialize` it opens `GET /mcp` as an event stream and
  writes each event as a line. It reconnects with a growing pause while the server is away.
- **Concurrency.** Each message is handled on its own, so a long `events_poll` does not hold up the
  calls behind it.
- **Exit.** When stdin closes it lets requests already sent finish (at most five seconds), ends the
  session so the agent leaves the connected list at once, and exits `0`.
- **Output.** Stdout carries protocol only. Everything else goes to stderr, which Claude Desktop
  keeps in its MCP log.
- **Token.** It is read from the environment or a file, never from the command line, which any user
  can see with `ps`. It is sent only to the address it was given, and redirects are not followed.
  A warning goes to stderr when the address is `http://` and not this Mac.

## Settings

| Setting             | Environment variable | Argument            | Default                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Address of Metocast | `METOCAST_MCP_URL`   | `--url ADDRESS`     | `http://127.0.0.1:3737/mcp` |
| Access token        | `METOCAST_MCP_TOKEN` | `--token-file PATH` | none                        |
| Check and exit      |                      | `--check`           |                             |

Exit codes: `0` ran or passed, `1` the check failed, `2` bad arguments.

## `--check`

```bash
METOCAST_MCP_TOKEN=<token> "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Metocast/mcp/metocast-mcp" mcp-stdio --check
```

It connects, initializes, lists the tools, ends the session and prints one line:

```
Metocast 0.1.0 answers at http://127.0.0.1:3737/mcp with 182 tools.
```

On failure it prints the reason below and exits `1`. This is the first thing to ask for when
something does not work. The tool count is lower on a Mac without Keynote, and in read-only mode.

## What the messages mean

An AI app shows these as the error of the call that failed.

| Message                                                                                | Cause and fix                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Metocast is not running, or the address is wrong (...)"                               | The app is closed, its server is stopped, or `--url` is wrong. Open Metocast. The address ends in `/mcp`. |
| "The access token is wrong or missing. Copy it again from Metocast ..."                | Copy the token again. Rotating it invalidates old configs.                                                |
| "MCP is turned off. Turn it on in the Metocast app under Connectors, AI Agents (MCP)." | Turn on **Enabled** and save.                                                                             |

| "Metocast answered 404 Not Found at (...)"                                             | Something else answers at that address, or it does not end in `/mcp`.                                     |
| "Metocast no longer knows this session and a new one could not be started."            | Metocast refused the new session too. Check the three lines above, then restart the AI app.               |
| "Could not talk to Metocast at (...): ..."                                             | The connection failed for another reason, for example a certificate. The reason follows.                  |
| "Metocast has not been opened on this Mac yet."                                        | From the extension's launcher: open the Metocast app once, then restart Claude.                           |

## Limits

- **macOS only.** The subcommand exists in every `metocast-server` build, but nothing packages it
  for Windows or Linux yet. There, clients that only speak stdio still need
  [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) (which needs Node), and HTTP clients
  need nothing.
- The Tauri desktop app runs the core inside itself and ships no helper, so it has no bridge. Its
  Sanctum page keeps the HTTP command and the `mcp-remote` config.
- **Subscriptions are not carried over a restart.** After the session is replaced, a client that
  had subscribed to a resource must subscribe again. Tools, resources and prompts keep working.
- JSON-RPC batches are passed through, but a failure on one is reported without an id.

## For maintainers

- Code: `crates/metocast-mcp-bridge` (a library, so it is tested without the server) and a
  first-line dispatch in `crates/metocast-server/src/bin/metocast-server.rs`.
- **The dispatch comes first.** `metocast-server` normally starts embedded PostgreSQL on a fixed
  port, and a failed start kills whatever listens there, which would be the running app's database.
  `mcp-stdio` must run before logging, the token check and the data directory.
  `crates/metocast-server/tests/mcp_stdio.rs` runs the real binary with an empty environment and
  checks it creates nothing.
- Tests: `cargo test -p metocast-mcp-bridge` (a fake server), the binary test above, and
  `e2e/mcp/stdio-bridge.test.ts` (the built binary behind the SDK's stdio client, against the test
  server). CI also runs `mcp-stdio --check` with an empty `PATH` against the built Mac app and fails
  if the helper links anything outside the system.
- The extension is `scripts/mcpb/` (manifest and launcher) packed by `scripts/build-mcpb.sh`. The
  Xcode build phase puts `Metocast.mcpb` in the app's Resources. It holds no binary, only a launcher
  that runs the helper at the link the app keeps.
- A change to the MCP protocol or session handling in `server/mcp.rs` must keep this subcommand and
  its e2e test passing.
