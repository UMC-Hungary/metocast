# Stored transcripts

Every live English transcript is saved as it runs. Each finished sentence goes into the core's
PostgreSQL database with its start and end time, in `transcript_sessions` and
`transcript_segments`. Nothing is written to a file until you download one. The **transcript
library** lets you list these sessions, read them, download them, delete them, and have AI clean
them up.

Only the English text is kept. The Hungarian source is never transcribed, so it is not stored.

## Use it

**Apple app:** **Settings → Server Tools → Transcripts**.

- The list shows each session's event, date, length and number of lines, newest first. It also
  marks the session that is live now and the ones that have been cleaned up.
- Open one to read it.
  - **Download** saves it as `.txt` (one line per sentence), `.srt` or `.vtt`. Subtitle times count
    from the start of the session. Files are named `transcript-<date>.en.vtt`: drop one on the
    Media page and it is taken as English, then placed sentence by sentence on the program's
    speech ([Media processing](media.md#transcripts)).
  - **Clean Up with AI** (see below).
  - **Delete** removes the session, with its original and cleaned-up text. This cannot be undone.
- Once a clean-up has succeeded, the **Original / Cleaned Up** switch picks which text is shown
  and downloaded.

**Sanctum:** **Stored transcripts**, linked from the dashboard's English transcript card
(`/transcripts`). It has the same list, reader, downloads, clean-up and delete.

The session that is live now cannot be deleted or cleaned up until it stops.

## AI clean-up

A live translation comes out sentence by sentence, so it has broken words, repeated fragments and
mistranslations. **Clean Up with AI** sends the finished English lines to OpenAI's `gpt-5-mini`.
It uses the API key of the **OpenAI Translation** connector, so it needs no new setup.

- The lines go in chunks of 40. Each chunk is sent with the cleaned lines just before it as
  context.
- The model rewrites each line into clear English. It drops lines that are only filler and never
  adds, merges or summarises anything.
- The cleaned text is kept **next to** the original, line by line, so the subtitle times still
  fit. The original is never changed.
- Progress arrives as `transcript.cleanup.state`.
- A successful pass replaces an earlier cleaned version. A failed pass leaves it as it was, and
  the error is shown on the transcript. Cleaning up again is always allowed.
- If the server stops during a pass, that pass is marked failed when the server starts again.
- **Cost:** a few cents for an hour-long service.

WebSocket push: `transcript.cleanup.state` `{ sessionId, state, progress, error }`. `state` is
`running`, `succeeded` or `failed`, and `progress` goes from 0 to 1.

Refusals:

- `409` with `transcript_live` for the live session.
- `409` with `transcript_cleanup_running` while a pass runs.
- `409` with `transcript_empty` for a session with no lines.
- `409` with `transcript_not_cleaned` for `clean=true` before a clean-up has succeeded.
- `400` with `transcription_not_configured` when OpenAI has no key.

Sessions are also deleted along with their event.
